## About Me

I am a software engineer seeking my degree in computer science; my first bachelor's degree is in physics from
Colorado State University. I was once upon a time a PhD candidate in Physics at Cornell before leaving to start
an industry career. I am currently employed as a software engineer at NetApp, where I work on several
applications in Scala, NodeJS, Python, and PHP. I enjoy climbing, bouldering, working on cars, ballroom dancing,
and reading.
