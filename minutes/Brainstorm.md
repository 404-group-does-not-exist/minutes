# Put Brainstorming Ideas here:

make a '##' level heading for each project idea and discuss pros and cons in two subheadings

for example:

## Idea 1: blah

### Pros
    - good 1
    - good 2
### Cons
    - bad 1
    - bad 2


# Here are the basic ideas so far.

## Music streaming party playlist thing

## Fake Financial Exchange

## could be device based or could be webscraping based
   some sort of data based app

## Use Raspi to measure people traffic: Is the library crowded right now? CSEL?

   - sniffs for wifi enabled devices

## p2p website: something similar to uber eats
"Craigslist but prettier"
 - formun-like
 - events only
 - CU only --  eventbrite clone-ish
