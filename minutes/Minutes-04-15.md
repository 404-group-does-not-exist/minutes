# Meeting April 15

Lots to discuss today. We are approaching the deadline. We are either presenting next week in recitation (04/24) or if we sign up to present in class that gives us an extra few days. Ultimately, we need to be simultaneaously working on the presentation while we finish implementing functions. This may be a great opportunity for people to add massive contributions that do not require writing code.

## Proposed Agenda

- State of the App:
  - UI changes
  - login/reg
  - sendgrid

- Requirements for presentation
  - everyone needs a brief biography
  - everyone must present, everyone must be present at presentation
  - needs to be well organized

- Plan going forward
  - delegate tasks
  - set up additional meeting times if necessary

## New Requirements / what is left to do

- upgrade heroku to hobby+
- main loop for email handler
- sendgrid
- db promises --> be able to post data

### UI issues

- currently a mix of local assets and CDN
   - should probably go with all local: get bootsrap stylesheets and use locally
   - problem: multiple potentially incompatible libraries
   - minimize use of js

- Keep it simple focus on bootstrap 4 or less and jQuery 3
- a page for everything (not singlepage with modals)
  - easier to debug

- login.ejs
- register.ejs

## Presentation stuff

- everyone bio
- slides
  - some slides can be what we learned as individuals
