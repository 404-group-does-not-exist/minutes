# Meeting April 15

Lots to discuss today. We are approaching the deadline. We are either presenting next week in recitation (04/24) or if we sign up to present in class that gives us an extra few days. Ultimately, we need to be simultaneaously working on the presentation while we finish implementing functions. This may be a great opportunity for people to add massive contributions that do not require writing code.

## Proposed Agenda

- State of the App:
  - UI changes
  - login/reg
  - sendgrid

- Requirements for presentation
  - everyone needs a brief biography
  - everyone must present, everyone must be present at presentation
  - needs to be well organized

- Plan going forward
  - delegate tasks
  - set up additional meeting times if necessary
