# Minutes Meeting 8

## Agenda

Great work getting this far everyone! There's a lot to discuss this week, so lets start by soothing the burn of the last "sprint" and have a quick retro before we dive into the next sprint.

- sprint retro

- current state of app (i.e. inventory of everything in use)

- Testing Plan - Next Milestone

- Assign new trello tasks/re-org trello


### Sprint Retro

- good job...everyone has at least one commit to front or back

- very close to gluing in functionality

- Complexity of our project feels large - so good job, handling it.

### state of app

- server: nodejs, express, travis CI, Open API

- node: python, postgresSQL

### Testing

- tests are set up using Travis CI: ensure tests pass for every PR 

#### What are the tests

- python/node sanity checks on DB queries - types, #'s of results, syntax, missing values.

- similar suite of tests for Nodejs 

- Robert writing test plan

## Open API

- provides a standard way to document our API autogenerated

- autogenerates clients from spec - autoroll structs - no need to look at json of API

- forces devs to think about data definitions: obey the spec results in good API

## What needs to happen next?

1. login/register: post handeler-db query match

2. See traffic: busy or not if traffic > threshold

3. Display by SSID or by * --query

4. export csv --> API call

5. Email: sendgrid + heroku

6. Graph: chart.js
