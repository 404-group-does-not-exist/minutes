# Hosting

Since we are learning Heroku and nodejs in this class anyway, it seems like Heroku is probably the best choice for free hosting.

The free account will allow us to have a db and nodejs app with all the resources that we should need. There is downtime associated with the free account but it shouldn't pose a problem

I will work through the tutorial on this page and share the demo app with ththe group:

[Getting started with Heroku and NodeJS](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/getting-started-with-nodejs) 
This will essientially be the same as what we are refferring to as the bare client for sprint 1.
